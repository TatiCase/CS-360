Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements of this app were to build a functional app that used a database to store daily weights, a target weight, and a username/password for logging in, and allow notification to be sent to the user. The app should allow a user to login using a button that added them to the user/password database if they were not already there. The daily weights should be able to be deleted by the user. The taret weight should only be able to be initially set and then edited. This app was creatged to allow the user to track daily weight track it against their target weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens needed were: login, home, history, add record, set/edit goal, and permissions. This gave each screen a primary function that made the app easy to use. My designs kept the users in mind by giving them something simple and friendly to interact with. There is no ambiguity as to what the screens are for and how to interact with them.. The designs make it clear and easy to interact with, which is pleasing for users.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I was challenged when creating this app. There were many times that I felt stone walled when the code would not wouk. This called for more research on my end to find the answers to the questions I had. Research would always be something I turn to when I am having a difficult time completing a project.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested primarly by running the app in the emulators. I also made extensive use of Toasts to highlight when acitons were completed successfully. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The biggest difficulty I had during this process was including all of the correct files. I kept getting errors because files couldn't be located. Once I figured out which include files I was missing, I was able run the app successfully. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe the UI was where I most successfully demonstrated my skills.I was able to achieve all of the user needs and keep the app simple to allow users with any experience level use it.
